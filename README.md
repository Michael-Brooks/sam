<h4> <center><bold>Sam</bold> is a CLI which will have personal automations. I am releasing it for others who might be interested.</center></h4>

This project will always be evolving, and it's mostly personal automations, but people are welcome to fork and create their own automations from here. I think the biggest automation most people will be interested in is sharing your latest blog post with your Mastodon followers.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

In order to use some of the automations, you will need headless Chrome and the Chrome driver installed because it uses Laravel Dusk as part of the automation.
